#' R bindings to the fstlib library
#'
#' R package `fstcore` contains R bindings to the C++ `fstlib` library which allows interfacing with _fst_ files.
#' It also contains the `LZ4` and `ZSTD` sources used for compression. `fstcore` exists as a package separate from the
#' `fst` package to facilitate independent updates to the `fstlib`, `LZ4` and `ZSTD` libraries and is used as a
#' backend to `fst`.
#'
#' The fstcore package is based on four C++ libraries:
#'
#' * **fstlib**: library containing code to write, read and compute on files stored in the _fst_ format.
#' Written and owned by Mark Klik.
#' * **LZ4**: library containing code to compress data with the LZ4 compressor. Written and owned
#' by Yann Collet.
#' * **ZSTD**: library containing code to compress data with the ZSTD compressor. Written by
#' Yann Collet and owned by Facebook, Inc.
#' * **libdivsufsort-lite**: a  lightweight suffix array construction algorithm. This code is bundled with
#' the ZSTD compression library. Written and owned by Yuta Mori.
